### Hardware interfaces
MemcardRex supports communication with the real Memory Cards via external devices.
<br>Make sure to select a proper COM port in Options->Preferences.

<details>
<summary>1. DexDrive</summary>
Original way of transferring data from MemoryCard to PC and vice versa albeit a little quirky.
<br>If you encounter problems, unplug power from DexDrive, unplug it from COM port and connect it all again.

It is recommended that a power cord is connected to DexDrive, otherwise some cards won't be detected.
<br>Works with native COM port or USB based adapters.

<summary>3. PS1CardLink</summary>
PS1CardLink is a software for the actual PlayStation and PSOne consoles.
<br>It requires an official or home made TTL serial cable for communication with PC.

With it your console becomes a Memory Card reader similar to the DexDrive and MemCARDuino.

MemcardRex can also talk to the serial port remotely by using a Serial Port Bridge like [esp-link](https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link).
<br>It conveniently fits into a PSOne which has otherwise no external hardware ports.

<summary>5. PS3 Memory Card Adaptor</summary>
The PS3 Memory Card Adaptor is an official Sony USB adapter that allows reading and writing PS1 Memory Cards on a PlayStation 3.
<br>To use it on a Windows PC, a custom USB driver needs to be installed.
 
This USB driver can be easily created and installed using [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie) by following these steps:
* Plug the PS3 Memory Card Adaptor into a free USB port and start Zadig.
* Zadig should display the PS3 MCA as an "Unknown Device". Verify that the USB ID matches: 054C 02EA
* Click the Edit checkbox and name the device "PS3 Memory Card Adaptor"
* Ensure that "WinUSB" is selected from the list of Driver options and click the Install Driver button.
* After about 30 seconds Zadig should show a message that the driver was installed successfully.

With the USB driver installed and the PS3 Memory Card Adaptor plugged in, you should now be able to read, write and format PS1 Memory Cards.
